# ARD
A widget that integrates URL,ASCLL,Unicode and UTF-8 codecs

This Program needs to run in the "C:\Program Files\Common Files" directory, please download and move it as a whole (i.e. the CRD directory) to C:\Program Files\Common in Files, then create a shortcut for "crd.exe", 'CRD.exe-ink' has been created, move it to where you want to save it.

Crd.exe cannot be uploaded directly, so I have packaged it as ARD.zip, please extract it yourself and rename the directory CRD for use again
